These tasks can be completed by [joining the Google Group](https://groups.google.com/g/google-analytics-utilities-users), [copying the template spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kJqwYNed8RTuAgjy0aRUooD__MIPqzUeiDF5LZ7v1aI/), and clicking on various options under the Google Analytics Utilities menu.

To access information about a given Analytics account, a user must have at least viewer permissions for the accounts, properties, and views they are interested in. If a user wants to create or update settings, they must have editor permissions.

All API requests are subject to the limitations [documented here](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/config/mgmt/v3/limits-quotas).


## How to Access the Spreadsheet

It is strongly recommended that you use the template spreadsheet to use the Google Analytics Utilities script. Follow these steps to make a copy of the template spreadsheet and start using the script:



1. Join [this group](https://groups.google.com/g/google-analytics-utilities-users) to access the spreadsheet.
2. Create a copy of [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kJqwYNed8RTuAgjy0aRUooD__MIPqzUeiDF5LZ7v1aI/copy).

The spreadsheet is now ready to use the Google Analytics Utilities script. The first time you run a function from the menu, you will need to authorize the permissions for the script and then run the function a second time. You may see a warning that the script is unauthorized. You should be able to proceed anyway. The script does not collect any information.

### APIs and Access Permissions

The script makes use of the following APIs/advanced app script services:

* Google Analytics Admin API
* Google Analytics Data API
* Google Drive API
* BigQuery API

### Limited Scope Template

If you are concerned about the access permissions required for the script, then please use [this sheet instead](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NUUS0LLz2dlPB2-hLS5hgbLad9akwM4bqaeZGZy2RCQ/copy). This sheet lacks some of the more advanced features, but it has more restricted scopes.

## Check for Updates

It is recommended to periodically run the "Check for Updates" menu item to see if a new version of the tool has been released.

## Features


### Color Coding

For the GA4 functions, whenever you check a box to archive/delete, create, or update, the sheet will highlight specific cells in each row that need to have values for the given setting to be modified or created. Please see additional details below:



* If a highlighted cell is empty, a row will remain white.
* When all the necessary fields have been entered to archive/delete a setting, the row will turn red.
* When all the necessary fields have been entered to create a setting, the row will turn green.
* When all the necessary fields have been entered to update a setting,  the row will turn blue.


### Action Taken Messages

If you archive, delete, create, or update a GA4 setting, then a corresponding action taken will be recorded in the same row. Errors will also be recorded in the "Action Taken" column. If you are missing a necessary value when trying to modify a setting, then that will likely be recorded in the "Action Taken" column taken. If you see "Error 404: HttpResponseException" then you are likely missing a value in the resource name column  (or the account ID column in the Property Details sheet) and should probably list your values again.

### GA4 Settings Report


#### Create a Report



1. List GA4 account summaries.
2. Select the properties for which you want to generate a report.
3. Navigate to the "Report Settings" sheet.
4. Enter the information as indicated for rows 4-9.
    1. If the "Template Slides URL" value is left as "Default" or is blank, then the default template will be used. Otherwise, a Google Slides URL of a template presentation must be provided.
    2. If the box for "Request New Settings Information" is checked, then GA Utilities will automatically list new information for several different GA4 sheets. This newly listed information will clear any existing settings listed in the sheets. This includes the following sheets: 
        1. GA4 Property Details
        2. GA4 Audiences
        3. GA4 Data Streams
        4. GA4 Key Events
        5. GA4 Custom Dimensions
        6. GA4 Custom Metrics
        7. GA4 Google Ads Links
        8. GA4 DV360 Links
        9. GA4 Firebase Links
5. The placeholder rows starting at row 10 can be added to, removed, or changed as you prefer. Each column works in the following way:
    1. **Placeholder Text:** This is the placeholder text found in the template spreadsheet. Each placeholder text can only be used once per slide. A placeholder can be whatever you want, but the behavior of the script will change if any of the following words are used:
        1. **percent**: If the word "percent" (all in lowercase) is used in the placeholder, then the value in the slide will be properly formatted as a percent and will change color depending on the information entered for the percent range color scale. The value in the spreadsheet must be a number.
        2. **image, graphic, or logo**: If the image, graphic, or logo (all lowercase) are used in the placeholder, then the value must be a URL that points to an image. The script will then try to swap out the placeholder in the template with the image from the URL.
        3. **list**: If the word "list" is used in the placeholder, then the script will try to create a bulleted list in the slide based on the value in the spreadsheet. The value in the spreadsheet will be split by the presence of double semicolons (;;). For example, the following would be split into two bullet points: <code><em>hello, world;;example list</em></code>. You can either construct a list value in a single line, or you can have multiple rows with the exact same placeholder name and the script will create a list for you from those rows. 
    2. <strong>Template Slide</strong>: The template slide column is used to determine which slide a given placeholder text belongs to. The template slide text must exist in the speaker notes section for a given slide in order for the script to identify the correct slide.
    3. <strong>Include</strong>: Either check the box or use a formula to determine if a placeholder should be considered when building the final presentation.
    4. <strong>Value</strong>: The final value that will appear on the slide where the placeholder text is present.
6. If your template includes one or more slides that need to be duplicated, then you must navigate to the "Report Settings - Snapshot" sheet and enter settings for those slides. This sheet can be customized in the following way:
    1. Column A: Contains the property ID for a given GA4 property and is included to make it easier to create formulas in other columns.
    2. Column B: Contains the template slide placeholder and is used to identify the template slide.
    3. Columns C+: The headers for these columns should contain the placeholder text that will be swapped with a real value when the report is complete.  Every row after the header should have a value for that specific property. These values can be derived from the other GA Utilities sheets or entered as plain text. The placeholder name rules are the same as previously stated: percent formats the number value as a percent on the slide, list creates a bulleted list, image/graphic/logo uses a provided URL as an image, and any other name just replaces the value on the slide as is.
7. Once all values have been entered, click GA Utilities > Advanced > Health Report > Create Report
8. Once the health report has been created, a link to the report and the date of its creation will be appended to columns F and G in the "Report Settings" sheet. The date of creation will default to MM-DD-YYYY format, but that can be reformatted if you so wish.
9. Review the new report and make any necessary adjustments. There may be some placeholders that aren’t removed if said placeholder was not included in the sheet but was present in the template. This is expected and you should delete the placeholder manually. You may also need to adjust image sizes, which is expected.
